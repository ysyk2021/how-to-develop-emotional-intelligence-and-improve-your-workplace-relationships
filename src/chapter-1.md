Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage emotions in oneself and others. It consists of four domains: self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and relationship management.

Self-awareness is the ability to recognize your own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and triggers. Self-regulation involves managing your emotions, avoiding impulsive behavior, and adapting to changing circumstances. Social awareness involves understanding the emotions and perspectives of others, while relationship management involves communicating effectively, inspiring and influencing others, and resolving conflicts.
